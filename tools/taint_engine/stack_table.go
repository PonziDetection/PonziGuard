// This code is an implementation of the Taint Engine used for analyzing and tracking taint data flow in smart contract execution.
// The Taint Engine marks and tracks the propagation paths of sensitive data in a program, 
// The Taint Engine help demonstrate the contract runtime behaviour, aiding in the discovery of potential security vulnerabilities such as Ponzi scheme.
